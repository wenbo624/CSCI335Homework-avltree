1.This assignment implements an avl tree which each node contains one enzyme acronym associated with one or more recognition sequences. We can check number of node, the internal path length, the  average depth and its ratio; find the tree for string and remove its node and so on by this assignment.

2.I have encountered the segmentation fault: 11.
For the test_tree, the output of 5b, 6b, 6c is little different with the output_part2b file, but they are very close to the answer.

3.To compile on terminal type:
You will use this exact Makefile for your Homework 2. If you need to change it, please consult with me first.

You can compile everything by typing 

make clean
make all

You can compile one program individually by just typing make <Program Name>, for example

make query_tree

By typing 

make clean

You can delete all .o files and executables.

--Note that file avl_tree_modified.h is not provided.

4.The test_input_file is in this directory.
